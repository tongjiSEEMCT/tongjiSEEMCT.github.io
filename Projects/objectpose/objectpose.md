### Accurate 6DOF Pose Tracking for Texture-Less Objects

#### Abstract

A reliable and accurate visual object pose tracking system plays an important role in various fields of modern industry and it has been a hot research topic for decades. 
Traditional pose tracking method needs feature points on objects, thus, it cannot be used on texture-less objects.
To resolve this problem, this paper proposes a novel edge matching based method for continuous 6DOF pose tracking of texture-less objects with known CAD model. 
The pose of the object is estimated by minimizing the error of object's projected edges from the CAD model, 
the error is calculated by the Direction Chamfer Matching (DCM) Tensor. 
Comparing with previous methods, the proposed system mainly improves the overall performance of pose tracking system in two ways: 
firstly, the proposed method uses analytical mathematic model in the optimization process; 
secondly, to tackle the occlusion problem the method proposes to uses adaptive weights to measure the influence of each point.
Both methods help improve the accuracy and robustness of the pose estimation.
Experiments are conducted both on public datasets and CG-rendered synthetic datasets to validate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed algorithm.
